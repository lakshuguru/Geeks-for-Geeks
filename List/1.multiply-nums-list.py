'''The problem of finding the summation of digits of numbers is quite common. This can sometimes come in form of a list and we need to perform that. This has application in many domains such as school programming and web development. 
Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this problem can be solved.'''


l=[4,2,3]
k=1
for i in range(len(l)):
        #k*=l[i]*l[i+1]
        k*=i
print(k)
